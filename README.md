This is the Kanzu Banking Software Engineering Coding Challenge 
To run the project after cloning it:
1. Installation of packages, use the command below at the root of the project
pnpm install

2. Once all packages are installed, use the command below to run the local server 
pnpm run dev

3. To check the Django api ,
cd sacco_api
python manage.py runserver
4. check local server normally at port 8000 for example
  http://localhost:8000/api

Assumptions made
- I used Next js because the use react alone is depleted as it is advised to use a framework preferably Next js 
- The use of a database is essential but can not be implemented within the short time interval given to really bring out the aim of the prject challenge
